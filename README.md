# css

- object contain vs object cover inside image
- object cover may croped the image
- object contain never croped the image

# for hover effect

- <div className="border rounded p-4 cursor-pointer hover:shadow-lg hover:scale-105 transition-transform duration-300">
  hover:shadow-lg → adds shadow on hover

hover:scale-105 → makes card slightly bigger

transition-transform duration-300 → smooth animation
